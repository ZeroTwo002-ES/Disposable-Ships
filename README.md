# Disposable-Ships
Add weapon that can launch drone/fighter, that will chase the target, until it's destroyed, or until it reach the time limit

inspired by @zoura3025 (Endless Sky Discord), Sestor Expansion plugins.

Version 0.3
Add four ship deployer weapon on hai (turret included)

- "Kamikaze Grasshopper (Ion)"
- "Kamikaze Grasshopper Turret (Ion)"
- "Kamikaze Grasshopper (Railgun)"
- "Kamikaze Grasshopper Turret (Railgun)"
- "Kamikaze Flea (Railgun)"
- "Kamikaze Flea Turret (Railgun)"
- "Kamikaze Flea (Mini Ion)"
- "Kamikaze Flea Turret (Mini Ion)"
- add "no asteroid collision" and "no minable collision" to all weapon, because i forgot, i use "too.many.asteroid" plugins by zuckung, makes me unaware about asteroids on vanilla games (must install plugins in my opinion, makes game run smoother)
- change all effect when ship crash onto target, with the one that will stop the explosion effect, so it will visible when they doing kamikaze move
- some minor fixing
