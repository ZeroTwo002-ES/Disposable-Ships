- add "inaccuracy" on all submunittion (hoping to get some swarming around the target effect)
- add "cluster" on all weapon, so it can really swarming the target (although the weapon itself have large size, might only can install one, so not much changes)
- reduce all space required to install one (happy noise), but keep the mass required and add some cargo space to replace the outfit space and weapon capacity (sad noise), inspired by @zoura3025 Phyop-main plugins
- adjust price of all weapons (depend on it's damage per second)
- add more submunittion to some weapon (balancing the price and the firepower given)
- increase some weapon split range, so it can begin shooting from further distance
- add fuel capacity to all weapon, enough for two shots
- reduce all weapon reload time, increasing dps and total swarmer at one time

- add "no asteroid collision" and "no minable collision" to all weapon, because i forgot, i use "too.many.asteroid" plugins by zuckung, makes me unaware about asteroids on vanilla games (must install plugins in my opinion, makes game run smoother)
- change all effect when ship crash onto target, with the one that will stop the explosion effect, so it will visible when they doing kamikaze move
- some minor fixing
